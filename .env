DISCORD_TOKEN=YOURTOKENHERE # The authentication token for the Discord bot. You can obtain this from the Discord Developer Portal.
STREAMING_ENABLED=true # Determines if the bot should stream responses in real-time. Set to 'true' for streaming or 'false' for a single response.
ENDPOINT="http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions" # The API endpoint for the AI server. This is where requests are sent to get AI-generated responses.
TEMPERATURE=0.8 # Controls the randomness of AI responses. Higher values (e.g., 1.0) make replies more creative, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make them more deterministic.
MAX_TOKENS=4500 # The maximum number of tokens the AI model can generate in a single response. Adjust based on performance needs.
SYSTEM_PROMPT="" # The predefined instruction that sets the AI's behavior and response style before interacting with users.
MESSAGE_LIMIT=2000 # The maximum number of characters per message, ensuring responses stay within Discord's message limits (max 2000 characters).
CHUNK_SIZE=100 # The number of characters added per message update when streaming AI responses. Helps prevent Discord rate limiting.
DISCORD_BOT_NAME="Discord AI" # The bot's name, set in the Discord Developer Portal. This variable is unused in code but can be stored for reference.
MODEL="phi-4" # The specific AI model used for generating responses. This should match a model available on the AI server (e.g., "phi-4").
